NAME

    Test::Module::CheckDep::Version - Unusable distribution to test
    Module::CheckDep::Version

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution does absolutely nothing but provide a reliable test
    case for Module::CheckDep::Version. It has no code whatsoever.

    It is required due to the said distribution relying on
    MetaCPAN::Client, and fetching a distribution known to have a
    <PREREQ_PM> which has a lower version than the most up-do-date release.
