=head1 NAME

Test::Module::CheckDep::Version - Unusable distribution to test Module::CheckDep::Version 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution does absolutely nothing but provide a reliable test case for
L<Module::CheckDep::Version>. It has no code whatsoever.

It is required due to the said distribution relying on L<MetaCPAN::Client>, and
fetching a distribution known to have a C<<PREREQ_PM>> which has a lower
version than the most up-do-date release.
